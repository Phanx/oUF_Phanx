Description

	oUF_Phanx is a layout for oUF, a unit frame framework.

	oUF_Phanx is primarily designed for PvE raid healing, but is quite
	usable for tanking and damage-dealing as well. The focus is on
	presenting the information a healer needs to make effective healing
	decisions in a clear and concise format.

	The player, pet, target, targettarget, focus, and focustarget units
	are currently supported. Support for party and partypet units will
	be added in a future release. There are no plans to add support for
	raid or other units.

	Features include incoming heal overlays, prioritized debuff and
	aggro/threat highlighting, resurrection status display, druid mana
	display while in bear/cat forms, global cooldown spark, smooth bar
	animation, and plugin support for AFK timers and ready check icons.

Usage

	Options are available in the Interface Options window. Type "/op"
	to open the window directly to the oUF_Phanx panel.

Localization

	Compatible with all locales.
	Translated into English.
