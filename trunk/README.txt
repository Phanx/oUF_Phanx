## Description

oUF_Phanx is a layout for oUF. I use it for PvE tanking, healing, and
melee damage-dealing.

Features include aggro highlighting, dispellable debuff highlighting,
incoming heal bars, incoming resurrection text, AFK timers, filtered
aura display, casting bars for player, pet, and target, and more
detailed text on mouseover.

Supports the player, pet, target, targettarget, focus, focustarget,
party, and partypet units. Boss frames will be added in the future.
Raid frames will **not** be added; use Grid or another raid frame addon
of your choice.

Supported plugins include oUF_MovableFrames, oUF_Smooth, and any other
plugin which does not require explicit support from within a layout.

Requires oUF 1.5.3 or higher:

## Usage:

Some basic options can be changed in the configuration panel. Find it in
the Interface Options window or by typing "/pouf".

A few additional options are available by editing the "oUF_Phanx.lua" 
file in your SavedVariables directory. Note that you must have logged 
in with the addon enabled, and then logged out or reloaded your UI, at 
least once before this file will appear. Also, you must log out before 
editing this file, or your changes will have no effect.

If you want to change something that doesn't have an option to change, 
you will need to modify the layout's code yourself, and I will NOT
provide any support or assistance for this. If you need help modifying
the code, post in the oUF forum on WoWInterface:

oUF_Phanx is primarily written to fill my own needs for PvE play, and 
most requests for major changes or additions will not be considered. If
you'd like to suggest a minor change, or request support for a plugin, 
feel free to submit a feature request ticket.


## **Bug Reports**

* http://www.wowinterface.com/portal.php?uid=28751&a=listbugs
* http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/ouf-phanx/tickets/?status=+&type=d

Before reporting a problem, please:

1. Double-check that you have the latest version of the addon.
2. Disable all other addons and see if the problem still happens.
3. Enable Lua error display or install BugSack to capture any error
   messages related to the problem.

When submitting a bug report, include:

* What version of the addon are you using?
* What version and language do you play WoW in?
* Does the problem happen when all other addons are disabled?
* What is the problem? What steps can I follow to reproduce it?
* Include exact text of the first related error message, if any.

Please DO NOT include lists of local variables or installed addons. Some
error addons append this information, but it's almost never relevant,
and always sucks to scroll through.

Remember to check on your ticket after a few days, as I may need more
information from you in order to identify or fix the problem!

addons. Use the ticket tracker or the comment page for those things.
