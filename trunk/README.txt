Features

	oUF_Phanx is a layout for oUF. It supports the player, pet, target,
	targettarget, focus, focustarget, party, and partypet units. There
	are no plans to add support for raid units.

	Features include a clear display of health and power, dispellable
	debuff highlighting, threat highlighting, incoming heal display,
	and pending resurrection display.

	oUF_Phanx supports oUF_AFK, oUF_ReadyCheck, oUF_Smooth, and any
	plugin which does not require explicit support from within a layout.

	oUF_Phanx requires oUF 1.4.2 or higher:

Usage

	* Type "/oufp" for options, or find them in the Interface Options.

Frequently Asked Questions

	Why do I get an error when trying to set a focus unit?

	This is a Blizzard problem that affects most unit frame addons.
	Until Blizzard fixes the underlying issue, you can set a focus unit
	by typing "/focus" or by binding a key to the "Focus Target" action
	in the Blizzard keybindings UI.

Localization

	* Compatible with all locales.
	* Translated into English.

	If you can provide translations for any locale, please contact me.

	oUF_Phanx is first and foremost designed to accomodate my personal

	If you encounter a problem with oUF_Phanx, please follow these easy
	steps to properly report the issue so I can fix it:

    1. Check the ticket tracker to see if someone else has already
       reported the problem. If so, then I am already aware of the
       problem; please do not submit a duplicate ticket.

	2. Try some basic troubleshooting steps to gather information about
	   the problem. Sometimes, you'll even solve the problem yourself,
	   without having to wait for a response to your ticket.

	3. Submit a bug report ticket describing the problem and any
	   troubleshooting steps you tried. If there are any error messages,
	   include their actual text. If the problem is graphical, include
	   a screenshot.
