Description
-----------

oUF_Phanx is a PvE-oriented layout for oUF.

Features include aggro highlighting, debuff highlighting with dispel
prioritization, incoming heal bars, resurrection status text, AFK timer
text, filtered aura display, casting bars for player/pet/target, and
more detailed health and power text on mouseover.

This layout supports the player, pet, target, target of target, focus,
target of focus, party, and party pet units. Boss unit frames will be
added in the future. Raid frames will *not* be added; use Grid or
another raid frame addon of your choice.

The oUF_Smooth plugin is supported, along with any other plugin which
does not require explicit support from within a layout. If you’d like to
see support for a specific plugin, post a feature request.

Requires oUF 1.5.3 or higher:

Usage
-----

Some basic options can be changed in the configuration panel. Find it in
the Interface Options window or by typing “/pouf”.

A few additional options are available by editing the “oUF_Phanx.lua”
file in your SavedVariables directory. Note that you must have logged
in with the addon enabled, and then logged out or reloaded your UI, at
least once before this file will appear. Also, you must log out before
editing this file, or your changes will have no effect.

If you want to change something that doesn’t have an option to change,
you will need to modify the layout’s code yourself, and I will *not*
provide any support or assistance for this. If you need help modifying
the code, post in the oUF forum on WoWInterface:
