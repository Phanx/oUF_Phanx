Usage
-----

Some basic options can be changed in the configuration panel. Find it in
the Interface Options window or by typing “/pouf”.

A few additional options are available by editing the “oUF_Phanx.lua”
file in your SavedVariables directory. Note that you must have logged
in with the addon enabled, and then logged out or reloaded your UI, at
least once before this file will appear. Also, you must log out before
editing this file, or your changes will have no effect.

If you want to change something that doesn’t have an option to change,
you will need to modify the layout’s code yourself, and I will *not*
provide any support or assistance for this. If you need help modifying
the code, post a thread in the oUF forum on WoWInterface:
